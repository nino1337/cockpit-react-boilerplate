## Getting started

Before starting to set up the workflow, make sure to have **Node** and **docker** installed on your machine and of course to clone this repo.

1. Open a terminal of your choice and navigate into the root of our repository.
2. Install all dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Initialise the workflow with `npm run init`.
4. Once done, run `npm start`.
5. Under http://localhost:8080 you should now be able to log-in with admin/admin. On http://localhost:3000 you should see the frontend with some pre-defined pages you can navigate to.
6. Happy coding

## Important Information

#### Don't touch folders in the cockpit directory (unless you know, what you are doing)

- Files in these folders are in sync with files laying on our docker container (see volumes in docker-compose file)
- Thus, editing or maintaining something in cockpit, automatically changes files on our local machine and vice versa
- This brings advantages like importing initial data on start up and having synchronous data across the team, so make sure to check them into git aswell
  
#### Add Layout Components

- in cockpit navigate to settings -> Layout Components, to add your own components
